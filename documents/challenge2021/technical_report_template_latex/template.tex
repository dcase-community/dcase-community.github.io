\begin{abstract}
In order to help authors prepare their technical reports for DCASE 2021 challenge, we compile a list of guidelines and put together two templates for users of both \LaTeX\ and Microsoft Word, which can be downloaded from the website at \cite{dcase2021web}. These guidelines and templates are modified from those for past ICASSP and WASPAA workshops. The paper can be written using American or British spelling, provided the usage is consistent.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The guidelines given below include complete descriptions of the fonts, spacing, and related information. Please use this template to produce uniformly looking DCASE 2021 Challenge technical reports.
If you have any questions, please email them to dcase.challenge@gmail.com.

\textbf{Please note that headers for challenge and workshop submissions have different header.} Use the appropriate template!




\section{Formatting your paper}
\label{sec:format}

All technical reports must be submitted as PDF files and must be formatted for white US letter paper (8.5 $\times$ 11 inches). Please do {\bf not} use A4-size papers. All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept within a print area of 7.0 inches (178 mm) wide by 8.9 inches (226 mm) high. Do not write or print anything outside the print area. The top margin must be 1 inch (25 mm), except for the title page, and the left margin must be 0.75 inch (19 mm).  All {\it text} must be in a two-column format. Columns are to be 3.29 inches (83.5 mm) wide, with a 0.31 inch (8 mm) space between them. Text must be fully justified. 

\section{NUMBER OF PAGES}
\label{sec:pagelimit}

You are allowed a total of up to 5 pages for your DCASE 2021 Challenge technical report. The report can also be shorter and does not need to include a literature review. If however you plan to submit the same report as a regular paper to DCASE 2021 Workshop, please structure it as a scientific paper and respect the rules given for the workshop paper formatting. 
%(that is, 4+1 pages, up to 4 pages for technical content including figures and possible references, with the optional 5th page containing only references. 
For the workshop submission you will also have to use the workshop paper template, which has different header.

\section{PAGE TITLE SECTION}
\label{sec:pagestyle}

The paper title (on the first page) should begin 0.98 inches (25 mm) from the top edge of the page, centered, completely capitalized, and in Times 14-point, boldface type. The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title in capital and lower case letters.  Papers with multiple authors and affiliations may require two or more lines for this information.

\section{TYPE-STYLE AND FONTS}
\label{sec:typestyle}

We strongly encourage you to use Times-Roman font. In addition, this will give the proceedings a more uniform look. Use a font that is no smaller than nine point type throughout the paper, including figure captions.

In nine point type font, capital letters are 2 mm high. {\bf If you use the smallest point size, there should be no more than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch) vertically.} This is a minimum spacing; 2.75 lines/cm (7 lines/inch) will make the paper much more readable. Larger type sizes require correspondingly larger vertical spacing. Please do not double-space your paper. True-Type 1 fonts are preferred.

The first paragraph in each section should not be indented, but all the following paragraphs within the section should be indented as these paragraphs demonstrate.

\section{MAJOR HEADINGS}
\label{sec:majhead}

Major headings, for example, ``1. Introduction'', should appear in all capital letters, bold face if possible, centered in the column, with one blank line before, and one blank line after. Use a period (``.'') after the heading number, not a colon.

\subsection{Subheadings}
\label{ssec:subhead}

Subheadings should appear in lower case (initial word capitalized) in boldface. They should start at the left margin on a separate line. 
 
\subsubsection{Sub-subheadings}
\label{sssec:subsubhead}

Sub-subheadings, as in this paragraph, are discouraged. However, if you must use them, they should appear in lower case (initial word capitalized) and start at the left margin on a separate line, with paragraph text beginning on the following line. They should be in italics. 
 

\section{Page Numbering, Header, and Footer}
\label{sec:page}

Please do {\bf not} paginate your paper. In addition, please do {\bf not} change and remove the header and footer.

\section{ILLUSTRATIONS, GRAPHS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS}
\label{sec:illust}

Illustrations must appear within the designated margins. They may span the two columns. If possible, position illustrations at the top of columns, rather than in the middle or at the bottom. Caption and number every illustration. All halftone illustrations must be clear black and white prints. Colors may be used, but they should be selected so as to be readable when printed on a black-only printer.

Since there are many ways, often incompatible, of including images (e.g., with experimental results) in a \LaTeX\ document, an example of how to do this is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:results}. 

% Below is an example of how to insert images. 
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig1a}}
  \caption{Example of a figure with experimental results.}
  \label{fig:results}
\end{figure}

\section{Equations}
\label{sec:equations}

Equations should be placed on separate lines and consecutively numbered with equation numbers in parentheses flush with the right margin, as illustrated in (\ref{eqn:wave_equation}) that gives the homogeneous acoustic wave equation in Cartesian coordinates \cite{eWilliams1999},
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:wave_equation}
    \Delta^2p(x,y,z,t)-
    \displaystyle\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2p(x,y,z,t)}{\partial t^2}=0,
\end{equation}
where $p(x,y,z,t)$ is an infinitesimal variation of acoustic pressure from its equilibrium value at position $(x,y,z)$ and time $t$, and where $c$ denotes the speed of sound.

Symbols in your equation should be defined before the equation appears or immediately following.  Use (1), not Eq. (1) or equation (1), except at the beginning of a sentence:  ``Equation (1) is ...''



\section{FOOTNOTES}
\label{sec:foot}

Use footnotes sparingly and place them at the bottom of the column on the page on which they are referenced. Use Times 9-point type, single-spaced. To help your readers, avoid using footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).

\section{REFERENCES}
\label{sec:ref}

List and number all bibliographical references at the end of the paper. The references should be numbered in order of appearance in the document. When referring to them in the text, type the corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence \cite{cJones2003}, \cite{aSmith2000}. For \LaTeX\ users, the use of the Bib\TeX\ style file IEEEtran.bst is recommended, which is included in the \LaTeX\ paper kit available from the DCASE 2021 website \cite{dcase2021web}.

\section{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}
\label{sec:ack}

The preferred spelling of the word acknowledgment in America is without an ``e'' after the ``g.'' Try to avoid the stilted expression, ``One of us (R. B. G.) thanks ...'' Instead, try ``R.B.G.\ thanks ...''  Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
