In this context, multi-modal models can help producing more accurate and robust predictions in machine learning tasks where audio-visual data is available. This paper presents a multi-modal model for automatic scene classification that exploits simultaneously auditory and visual information. The proposed approach makes use of two separate networks which are respectively trained in isolation on audio and visual data, so that each network specializes in a given modality. The visual subnetwork is a pre-trained VGG16 model followed by a bidiretional recurrent layer, while the residual audio subnetwork is based on stacked squeeze-excitation convolutional blocks trained from scratch. After training each subnetwork, the fusion of information from the audio and visual streams is performed at two different stages. The early fusion stage combines features resulting from the last convolutional block of the respective subnetworks at different time steps to feed a bidirectional recurrent structure. The late fusion stage combines the output of the early fusion stage with the independent predictions provided by the two subnetworks, resulting in the final prediction. We evaluate the method using the recently published TAU Audio-Visual Urban Scenes 2021, which contains synchronized audio and video recordings from 12 European cities in 10 different scenes classes. The proposed model has been shown to provide an excellent trade-off between prediction performance (86.5%) and system complexity (15M parameters) in the evaluation results of the DCASE 2021 Challenge.\",\n","    _pdf = {../documents/workshop2021/proceedings/DCASE2021Workshop_Naranjo-Alcazar_11.pdf},\n","    _authors = \"Javier Naranjo-Alcazar (Universitat de València); Sergi Perez-Castanos (Universitat de València); Maximo Cobos (Universitat de Valencia); Francesc J.

BC-ResNet-ASC outperforms the baseline architecture even though it contains the small number of parameters.

This fact is used in the we4bee project, where beehives are equipped with sensors (among them microphones), distributed to educational institutions and set up to record colony characteristics at the communication level. Due to data protection laws, we have to ensure that no human is recorded besides the bees' sound. However, detecting the presence of speech is challenging since the frequencies of human speech and the humming of bees largely overlap. Despite having access to only a limited amount of labeled data, in this initial study we show how to solve this problem using Siamese networks. We find that using common convolutional neural networks in a Siamese setting can strongly improve the ability to detect human speech in recordings obtained from beehives.  By adding train-time augmentation techniques, we are able to reach a recall of up to 100 %, resulting in a reliable technique adhering to privacy regulations. Our results are useful for research projects that require written permits for acquiring data, which impedes the collection of samples. Further, all steps, including pre-processing, are calculated on the GPU, and can be used in an end-to-end pipeline, which allows for quick prototyping.\",\n","    _pdf = {../documents/workshop2021/proceedings/DCASE2021Workshop_Janetzky_13.pdf},\n","    _authors = \"Pascal Janetzky (University Wuerzburg); Padraig Davidson (University of Würzburg); Michael Steininger (University of Würzburg); Anna Krause (Universität Würzburg, Department of Computer Science, CHair X Data Science); Andreas Hotho (Universitat Wurzburg)\",\n","    _video = {}\n","}\n","\n","@inproceedings{Cai2021,\n","    author = \"Cai, Xinyu and Dinkel, Heinrich\",\n","    title = \"A Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning Framework For Anomaly Sound Detection\",\n","    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2021 Workshop (DCASE2021)\",\n","    address = \"Barcelona, Spain\",\n","    month = \"November\",\n","    year = \"2021\",\n","    pages = \"X--Y\",\n","    abstract = \"Anomaly Sound Detection (ASD) is a popular topic in deep learning and has attracted the attention of numerous researchers due to its practical applications within the industry. In the case of unsupervised conditions, how to better discover the inherent consistency of normal sound clips has become a key issue in ASD. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that jointly trains two different feature extractors using contrastive loss to obtain a better representation of normal sounds in the latent space. We evaluate our framework on the development dataset of DCASE 2021 challenge task 2. Our framework is a combination of two baseline systems from the challenge: 1) An AutoEncoder-based model and 2) a MobileNetV2-based model. Our approach trains two models, whereas during inference only model 2) is used. Experimental results indicate that the MobileNetV2-based model trained under our proposed training framework exceeds the baseline model in terms of the official score metric. Since we participated in the challenge and submitted the system trained on the proposed framework with some data augmentation methods, we also analyze the results of DCASE 2021 challenge task 2 and discuss the effect of the median filter as a data augmentation technique.

Compared to the baseline, our model only contains 600k parameters, resulting in a size of 2.7 Mb on disk, making it viable for applications on low-resource devices such as mobile phones. As a novelty, our approach uses unsupervised data augmentation (UDA) as the primary consistency criterion, which we show can achieve competitive performance to the more common mean teacher paradigm. Our submitted results on the validation set result in a single model peak performance of 36.91 PSDS-1 and 57.17 PSDS2, outperforming the baseline by an absolute of 2.7 and 5.0 points respectively. The best submitted ensemble system using a 5-way fusion achieves a PSDS-1 of 38.23 and PSDS-2 of 62.29 on the validation dataset.

This paper proposes a novel approach for automated audio captioning based on incorporating semantic and acoustic information. Specifically, our audio captioning model consists of two sub-modules. (1) The pre-trained keyword encoder utilizes pre-trained ResNet38 to initialize its parameters, and then it is trained by extracted keywords as labels. (2) The multi-modal attention decoder adopts an LSTM-based decoder that contains semantic and acoustic attention modules. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Clotho dataset.

Although these factors play a well-understood role in the performance of ASC models, most works report single evaluation metrics taking into account all different strata of a particular dataset. We argue that metrics computed on specific sub-populations of the underlying data contain valuable information about the expected real-world behavior of proposed systems, and their reporting could improve the transparency and trustability of such systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation process in uncovering underspecification and fairness problems exhibited by several standard ML architectures when trained on two widely-used ASC datasets.

The acoustical synthesis remains the same as in the previous iteration of the challenge, however the new dataset brings more challenging conditions of polyphony and overlapping instances of the same class. The most important difference is the introduction of directional interferers, meaning sound events that are localized in space but do not belong to the target classes to be detected and are not annotated. Since such interfering events are expected in every real-world scenario of SELD, the new dataset aims to promote systems that deal with this condition effectively. A modified SELDnet baseline employing the recent ACCDOA representation of SELD problems accompanies the dataset and it is shown to outperform the previous one. The new dataset is shown to be significantly more challenging for both baselines according to all considered metrics. To investigate the individual and combined effects of ambient noise, interferers, and reverberation, we study the performance of the baseline on different versions of the dataset excluding or including combinations of these factors.

Utilising such data for training is becoming increasingly popular, but the problem of label noise that is often prevalent in such datasets requires further investigation. This paper introduces ARCA23K, an Automatically Retrieved and Curated Audio dataset comprised of over 23000 labelled Freesound clips. Unlike past datasets such as FSDKaggle2018 and FSDnoisy18K, ARCA23K facilitates the study of label noise in a more controlled manner. We describe the entire process of creating the dataset such that it is fully reproducible, meaning researchers can extend our work with little effort. We show that the majority of labelling errors in ARCA23K are due to out-of-vocabulary audio clips, and we refer to this type of label noise as open-set label noise. Experiments are carried out in which we study the impact of label noise in terms of classification performance and representation learning.\",\n","    _pdf = {../documents/workshop2021/proceedings/DCASE2021Workshop_Iqbal_66.pdf},\n","    _authors = \"Turab Iqbal (University of Surrey); Yin Cao (University of Surrey); Andrew Bailey (University of Surrey); Mark D.

Moreover, evaluation metrics are incorporated into the optimization of the model with reinforcement learning, which helps address the problem of ``exposure bias'' induced by ``teacher forcing'' training strategy and the mismatch between the evaluation metrics and the loss function.

However, CNNs can be limited in modelling temporal relationships among the time frames in an audio signal, while RNNs can be limited in modelling the long-range dependencies among the time frames. In this paper, we propose an Audio Captioning Transformer (ACT), which is a full Transformer network based on an encoder-decoder architecture and is totally convolution-free. The proposed method has a better ability to model the global information within an audio signal as well as capture temporal relationships between audio events.

Our advancement over our earlier model is threefold. First, we introduce a strong label loss in the objective of the FBCRNN to take advantage of the strongly labeled synthetic data during training. Second, we perform multiple iterations of self-training for both the FBCRNN and tag-conditioned SED models. Third, while we used only tag-conditioned CNNs as our SED model in the previous edition we here explore sophisticated tag-conditioned SED model architectures, namely, bidirectional CRNNs and bidirectional convolutional transformer neural networks (CTNNs), and combine them. With metric and class specific tuning of median filter lengths for post-processing, our final SED model, consisting of 6 submodels (2 of each architecture), achieves on the public evaluation set poly-phonic sound event detection scores (PSDS) of 0.455 for scenario 1 and 0.684 for scenario as well as a collar-based F1-score of 0.596 outperforming the baselines and our model from the previous edition by far.

Second, while the semi-supervised learning capability adopted for training sound event detection systems with synthetic labeled data and unlabeled or partially labeled real data aims to learn invariant representations for both domains, there is still a gap in performance when testing such systems on real environments. To further reduce this data mismatch, we propose a domain adaptation strategy that aligns the empirical distributions of the feature representations of active and inactive frames of synthetic and real recordings via optimal transport.
